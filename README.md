### Hello ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Mike, an experienced engineer and technology freak with almost a decade of professional experience building web and mobile applications. Relationships, trust and excellence are my core values and they serve as the foundation of my work, which makes me a pleasant person to work with.

### Talks & Articles ðŸŽ™
